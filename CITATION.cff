title: 'edgebuildings: Model for the projection of global energy demand in the buildings
  sector'
version: 0.3.13
date-released: '2025-02-17'
abstract: 'The Energy Demand GEnerator projects energy demand for buildings both at
  the useful and final energy level. It covers the global demand and five energy services:
  space heating, space cooling, appliances and lighting (treated together) water heating
  and cooking. In a nutshell, it computes the useful energy intensity of each service
  in different regions, taking into account climate conditions as well as floor space
  demand. It then projects energy demand based on the assumption that, as developing
  countries grow economically, they will catch up with the energy service demand of
  developed countries. Further assumptions are made for the level beyond the current
  level of economic development (saturation or lower growth).'
