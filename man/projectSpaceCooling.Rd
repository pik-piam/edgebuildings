projected space cooling energy demand extending the
historical "space_cooling" variable data.

\description{
This function projects future space cooling useful energy demand and models air
conditioner (AC) penetration rates as a function of GDP per capita and cooling degree
days (CDD) using a logistic function with climate-adjusted parameters.
}
\details{
Space cooling energy demand is calculated using:
\deqn{space\_cooling =  \phi_1 \cdot floor space \cdot uvalue \cdot CDD \cdot penetration rate}

The AC penetration rate component follows the logistic formula:
\deqn{penetration = 1 / (1 + \exp(\alpha - \beta \cdot gdppop^\delta \cdot CDD^\gamma))}

The model incorporates regional adjustments through region-specific beta
coefficients (\eqn{\beta_{reg}}) that are calibrated to match historical
AC penetration rates. This allows for regional variations in adoption patterns
while maintaining the global functional form of the penetration curve.

For regions with historical data, regional beta coefficients are derived to
match the last historical reference point. The regional scaling parameter (\eqn{\phi_1}),
or cooling activity, is derived from a linear fit on historical data. Regional
activity factors converge toward a globally-derived activity factor over time,
controlled by GDP per capita thresholds and time-based convergence factors. The
global convergence target is adjusted by tolerance bands that scale the deviation
based on how far the regional value differs from the global estimate, allowing
for more gradual convergence for extreme regional deviations.

The function assumes that the input \code{data} contains a single non-"history"
scenario.
