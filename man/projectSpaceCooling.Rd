\description{
This function projects future space cooling useful energy demand and models air
conditioner (AC) penetration rates as a function of GDP per capita and cooling degree
days (CDD) using a logistic function.
}
\details{
Space cooling energy demand is calculated using:
\deqn{space\_cooling =  \phi_1 \cdot floor space \cdot uvalue \cdot CDD \cdot penetration rate}

The AC penetration rate component follows the logistic formula:
\deqn{penetration = 1 / (1 + \exp(\alpha - \beta \cdot (gdppop - gdppopShift)^\delta \cdot CDD^\gamma))}

The model incorporates regional adjustments through region-specific GDP per capita
shifts (\eqn{gdppopShift}) that are calibrated to match historical AC penetration
rates. This allows for regional variations in adoption patterns while maintaining
the global functional form of the penetration curve with global parameters
(\eqn{\alpha}, \eqn{\beta}, \eqn{\gamma}, \eqn{\delta}).

The regional scaling parameter (\eqn{\phi_1}),
or cooling activity, is derived from a linear fit on historical data. Regional
activity factors converge toward a globally-derived activity factor over time,
controlled by GDP per capita thresholds and time-based convergence factors.

The convergence process uses two different interpolation curves depending on whether
regional activity is above or below the global target:
\itemize{
\item For regions where \eqn{activity_{regional} < activity_{global}} (ratio < 1):
Uses \code{fullconv} (logistic S-curve) for traditional slow-fast-slow convergence
\item For regions where \eqn{activity_{regional} \ge activity_{global}} (ratio >= 1):
Uses \code{expconv} (exponential approach) with formula
\eqn{f(x) = (1 - \exp(-sharpness \cdot x)) / (1 - \exp(-sharpness))}
to provide quick initial departure from extreme values followed by smooth
asymptotic approach to the global target, avoiding wave-like demand patterns
}

The global convergence target is adjusted by a continuous tolerance function that
scales the deviation based on how far the regional value differs from the global
estimate, allowing for more gradual convergence for extreme regional deviations.

The function assumes that the input \code{data} contains a single non-"history"
scenario.
