\title{Project Space Cooling Energy Demand}
\usage{
projectSpaceCooling(data, acOwnershipRates, endOfHistory)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame with historical and scenario data}

\item{acOwnershipRates}{data frame with historical AC penetration rates}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input \code{data}, but with
projected space cooling energy demand extending the
historical "space_cooling" variable data.
}
\description{
This function projects future space cooling useful energy demand and models air
conditioner (AC) penetration rates as a function of GDP per capita and cooling degree
days (CDD) using a logistic function with climate-adjusted parameters.
}
\details{
Space cooling energy demand is calculated using:
\deqn{space\_cooling =  \phi_1 \cdot floor space \cdot uvalue \cdot CDD \cdot penetration rate}

The AC penetration rate component follows the logistic formula:
\deqn{penetration = 1 / (1 + \exp(\alpha - \beta \cdot gdppop \cdot CDD))}

The model incorporates two key assumptions:
\enumerate{
\item All regional penetration curves originate from the same point at
gdppop = 0
\item The curve elongation parameter (\eqn{\phi_3}) decreases monotonically
with rising CDDs to account for dampened/accelerated technology adoption
due to regional climate
}

For regions with historical data, regional beta coefficients are derived to
match the last historical reference point. The scaling parameter (\eqn{\phi_1})
is adjusted to match historical useful energy demand and maintain consistency
in future projections.

The function assumes that the input \code{data} contains a single non-"history"
scenario.
